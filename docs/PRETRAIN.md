# DreamDojo Pretraining

We provide a launching script for DreamDojo pretraining (suppose you are training on 1 node with 8 GPUs).

1. Make sure you have set the correct paths in `launch.sh`.
2. Replace the `ckpt_path` in `cosmos_predict2/_src/predict2/models/text2world_model_rectified_flow.py` to the actual latent action model path.
3. Launch DreamDojo pretraining.
    
    ```
    bash launch.sh dreamdojo_2b_480_640_pretrain
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> The pretrained DreamDojo checkpoints (2B and 14B) can be found at [Hugging Face]().
